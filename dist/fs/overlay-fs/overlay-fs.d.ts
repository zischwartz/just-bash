/**
 * OverlayFs - Copy-on-write filesystem backed by a real directory
 *
 * Reads come from the real filesystem, writes go to an in-memory layer.
 * Changes don't persist to disk and can't escape the root directory.
 *
 * Security: Symlinks are blocked by default (allowSymlinks: false).
 * All real-FS access goes through resolveRealPath_() / resolveRealPathParent_()
 * gates which detect symlink traversal via path comparison and return the
 * canonical path for I/O (closing the TOCTOU gap). New methods must use these
 * gates — never access the real FS directly.
