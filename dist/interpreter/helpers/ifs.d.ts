/**
 * Strip trailing IFS from the last variable in read builtin.

 * Bash behavior:
 * 1. Strip trailing IFS whitespace characters (but NOT if they're escaped by backslash)
 * 2. If there's a single trailing IFS non-whitespace character, strip it ONLY IF
 *    there are no other non-ws IFS chars in the content (excluding the trailing one)
 *
 * Examples with IFS="x ":
 * - "ax  " -> "a" (trailing spaces stripped, then trailing single x stripped because no other x)
 * - "ax" -> "a" (trailing single x stripped because no other x in remaining content)
 * - "axx" -> "axx" (two trailing x's, so don't strip - there's another x)
 * - "ax  x" -> "ax  x" (trailing x NOT stripped because there's an x earlier)
 * - "bx" -> "b" (trailing x stripped, no other x)
 * - "a\ " -> "a " (backslash-escaped space is NOT stripped)
 *
 * @param value - String to strip (raw, before backslash processing)
 * @param ifs - IFS characters
 * @param raw - If true, backslash escaping is disabled
