 * The status bash gives a command that has no command word.
 *
 * It is the status of the last command substitution performed while expanding
 * the command — assigned values and redirection words alike, in that order —
 * and 0 when no substitution ran. A bare `x=1` is therefore 0 rather than
 * whatever the previous command left in `$?`.
 *
 * A redirection onto fd 0 overrides all of that with 0. bash performs the
 * redirections of a null command in a forked child when one of them reads
 * stdin (`execute_null_command`'s `forcefork`), so the shell reports the
 * child's status and any substitution in the words is discarded:
 * `x=$(exit 7) < /dev/null` is 0, while `x=$(exit 7) 3< /dev/null` is 7.
 *
 * Verified against GNU bash 5.3. bash 3.2 predates the fork and reports 7 for
 * both; this follows 5.x, which is what the comparison fixtures are recorded
 * against.
