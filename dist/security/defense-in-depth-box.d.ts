/**
 * Defense-in-Depth Box
 *
 * A security layer that monkey-patches dangerous JavaScript globals during
 * bash script execution. Uses AsyncLocalStorage to track execution context,
 * so blocks only apply to code running within bash.exec() - not to concurrent
 * operations in the same process.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is a SECONDARY defense layer. It should never be relied upon
 * as the primary security mechanism. The primary security comes from proper
 * sandboxing, input validation, and architectural constraints.
 *
 * Key design decisions:
 * - AsyncLocalStorage for context tracking (blocks only affect sandboxed code)
 * - Reference counting for nested exec() calls
 * - Patches are process-wide but checks are context-aware
 * - Violations are recorded even in audit mode
 *
 * Dynamic import() mitigation (three layers):
 * 1. ESM loader hooks (module.register/registerHooks):
 *    - block data:/blob: URLs only in the untrusted async context
 *    - block Node.js builtin specifiers in untrusted sandbox context
 * 2. Module._resolveFilename blocked — catches file-based specifiers
 * 3. Filesystem restrictions — OverlayFs writes to memory only
 *
 * Runtimes with only module.register() (no registerHooks) resolve auto mode as
 * unsupported and reject explicitly enabled activation. Their separate loader
 * thread cannot observe AsyncLocalStorage, so installing a partial or
 * process-global fallback would either be misleading or break unrelated host
 * imports.
