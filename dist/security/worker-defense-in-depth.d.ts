/**
 * Worker Defense-in-Depth
 *
 * A simplified version of DefenseInDepthBox designed for use in Worker threads.
 * Since workers have their own isolated V8 context, we don't need AsyncLocalStorage
 * to track execution context - the entire worker IS the sandboxed context.
 *
 * Key differences from DefenseInDepthBox:
 * - No AsyncLocalStorage (always blocks, no context tracking needed)
 * - Single activation model (apply patches once at worker startup)
 * - Violations reported via callback (typically postMessage to parent)
 *
 * Usage in a worker:
 * ```typescript
 * import { parentPort } from 'node:worker_threads';
 * import { WorkerDefenseInDepth } from '../security/worker-defense-in-depth.js';
 *
 * // Apply patches at worker startup
 * const defense = new WorkerDefenseInDepth({
 *   onViolation: (v) => parentPort?.postMessage({ type: 'security-violation', violation: v }),
 * });
 *
 * // All code in the worker is now protected
 * // Attempting Function, eval, etc. will throw SecurityViolationError
 * ```
 *
 * Constructor Protection:
 * Function.prototype.constructor returns a proxy that allows property reads
 * (e.g., `.constructor.name` for type introspection) but blocks invocation
 * (e.g., `.constructor("code")` for dynamic code execution).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is a SECONDARY defense layer. It should never be relied upon
 * as the primary security mechanism. The primary security comes from proper
 * sandboxing, input validation, and architectural constraints.
 *
 * Dynamic import() mitigation (three layers):
 * 1. Module._resolveFilename blocked — catches file-based specifiers
 * 2. Main-thread ESM loader hooks block data:/blob: URLs (not in workers)
 * 3. Filesystem restrictions — OverlayFs writes to memory only
 *
 * Note: ESM loader hooks are registered by DefenseInDepthBox in the main
 * thread. Workers inherit the hooks automatically. Worker-level registration
 * is not needed (and would require require('node:module') which is blocked).
