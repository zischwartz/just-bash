/**
 * Blocked Globals for Defense-in-Depth Box
 *
 * This module defines which JavaScript globals should be blocked during
 * bash script execution to prevent code execution escape vectors.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is a SECONDARY defense layer. The primary security comes
 * from proper sandboxing and architectural constraints.
 *
 * NOTE: Dynamic import() is handled separately in defense-in-depth-box.ts via
 * ESM loader hooks. This module only defines global/property patching.
