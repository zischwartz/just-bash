/**
 * Process Substitution
 *
 * Implements bash's `<(cmd)` and `>(cmd)`.
 *
 * Real bash runs `cmd` asynchronously connected to a pipe and substitutes the
 * pipe's path (`/dev/fd/N`, or a FIFO on systems without `/dev/fd`). There are
 * no processes or pipes here, so the construct is modelled with the same
 * building blocks the rest of the interpreter uses for fds: a backing file in
 * the VFS under `/dev/fd/`, whose contents are produced (or consumed) by
 * running the body as a subshell.
 *
 * - `<(cmd)` runs `cmd` eagerly during word expansion, writes its stdout to
 *   the backing file, and substitutes that path. Because the body is fully
 *   buffered, a body that never terminates on its own (e.g. `yes`) is bounded
 *   by the ordinary execution limits rather than by the reader closing the
 *   pipe.
 * - `>(cmd)` substitutes an empty writable backing file. Once the command that
 *   consumed the path has finished, whatever was written to the file is fed to
 *   `cmd` as stdin and `cmd`'s output is appended to the result — the closest
 *   deterministic analogue of bash's asynchronous writer.
 *
 * Backing files live only for the duration of the command whose expansion
 * created them: {@link markProcessSubstitutions} / {@link releaseProcessSubstitutions}
 * bracket every command execution, so fd numbers are reused (63, 62, … just
 * like bash) and nothing accumulates in the VFS across commands.

 * filesystem it was handed, but a process substitution is a pipe, not a file
 * write: real bash runs `cat <(cmd)` and `tee >(cmd)` fine on a read-only
 * mount. Both directions need writes to succeed — `<(cmd)` to materialise the
 * body's output, and `>(cmd)` for the *outer* command (`tee`, a `>` redirect,
 * any command handed the path) to write into it.
 *
 * Rather than special-case each writer, the whole `/dev/fd` subtree is routed
 * to a throwaway `InMemoryFs`. Everything else still goes to the filesystem the
 * caller supplied, unchanged and still read-only. The mount lives for one
 * execution and never reaches the host filesystem, so nothing the sandbox
 * exposes changes — and because the mount is genuinely writable, descriptors
 * are removed on release instead of leaving stale entries behind.
 *
 * A fresh `MountableFs` wraps the caller's filesystem; the caller's own object
 * is never mutated, even if it happens to be a `MountableFs` itself. The
 * mounted filesystem only accepts writes to descriptors that are live right
 * now, so the read-only contract still holds for every other path.
