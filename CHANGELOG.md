# just-bash

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#413](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/413) [`2d9d41f`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/2d9d41fd90ad024cf54a7bc0caa345af7966c410) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - `diff` now defaults to POSIX normal format (`2c2` / `<` / `---` / `>`) instead of unified, matching GNU diffutils and POSIX. **This changes the default output and will break anything parsing the previous unified-by-default output** — pass `-u` to keep unified.

  Previously `-u` was parsed and discarded, `createTwoFilesPatch` was the only output path, and every invocation was prefixed with jsdiff's 67-character `===...===` banner, which is not valid output in any GNU format. Normal format was unreachable by any flag, so `diff a b | grep '^<'` — the canonical "lines only in A" idiom — silently matched nothing and exited cleanly on files that differ.

  - `-u` / `--unified` now selects unified format, and `--normal` selects the default explicitly.
  - New `-c` / `--context` for context format (`*** ` / `--- ` / `***************` / `! `).
  - New `--version`.
  - The `===` banner is gone from every format. The `-u` / `-c` file headers carry no timestamp, so output is reproducible; GNU puts each file's mtime there.
  - Filenames in `-u` / `-c` headers are quoted and escaped as GNU does, so a filename containing a newline can no longer forge header or `@@` lines in the emitted patch.
  - Two output styles at once (for example `diff -u -c`) is now an error, as in GNU: `diff: conflicting output style options`, exit 2.
  - `\ No newline at end of file` is reported in all three formats.

  `-q`, `-s`, `-i`, `-` for stdin, and the exit codes are unchanged.

  Hunk selection is unchanged: where several equally minimal edit scripts exist, just-bash may group ambiguous changes differently than GNU. The output is always a correct, equally minimal patch, but the `NcN` line numbers can differ on such inputs.

- [#380](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/380) [`63cd013`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/63cd01319691db61d4f239335c58940257c1f864) Thanks [@caleb-vercel](https://github.com/caleb-vercel)! - Replace bespoke `secureFetch` with `guarded-fetch` 0.1.3 for the SSRF/DNS-rebinding/transport layer

  `src/network/fetch.ts` becomes an adapter over
  [`guarded-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/guarded-fetch) (0.1.3, Vercel,
  Apache-2.0, undici-backed). The public `createSecureFetch` / `SecureFetch` /
  `SecureFetchOptions` / `FetchResult` contract is unchanged, so Bash, curl, and
  worker-bridge callers need no changes.

  **Delegated**: SSRF/private-IP blocking, DNS-rebinding protection (connect-time
  IP pinning), protocol allow-listing, URL validation.

  **Retained**: path-prefix allow-list (guarded-fetch is hostname-only), firewall
  header transforms, response-size limits, `FetchResult` translation, and error
  mapping back to just-bash's domain errors.

  **Redirects** are still driven here so firewall headers and path policy are
  re-applied per hop. Method rewriting follows the fetch standard (301/302 rewrite
  POST only, 303 rewrites all but GET/HEAD, 307/308 preserve both), the rewritten
  method is re-checked against `allowedMethods`, and user credentials are dropped
  on cross-origin hops.

  **Transport**: with `denyPrivateRanges` on, requests use guarded-fetch's own
  undici `fetch` — a host-wrapped `globalThis.fetch` (framework fetch cache, APM
  agent, request mocking) can rebuild the init and drop the non-standard
  `dispatcher`, silently reopening the rebinding window. With it off, no pinning
  is promised and the ambient `fetch` is used.

  **Browser**: no guarded transport exists (undici is Node-only), so the ambient
  `fetch` path is kept and `denyPrivateRanges` fails closed with "DNS pinning
  unavailable for private IP enforcement", matching the old
  `DnsPinningUnavailableError`. The bundle contains no import of `guarded-fetch`.

  **Not delegated**: header sanitization (`sanitizeHeaders: false`) — just-bash's
  firewall headers are its own layer, and the sandbox may set Cookie/Host via
  curl; and guarded-fetch's own redirect following, for the reason above.

  ## Breaking-ish notes

  - Node engine floor `>=20.18.1` → `>=20.19` (guarded-fetch's).
  - `guarded-fetch` is externalized in the `build:lib`, `build:lib:cjs`, and
    `build:browser` bundles. Consumers who re-bundle just-bash must mark it
    external; `AGENTS.npm.md` now documents all six such packages.
  - `NetworkConfig._dnsResolve` and `._createConnectionOwner` (both `@internal`)
    can no longer be honored and now **throw**, rather than being accepted while a
    weaker policy runs. `._fetch` replaces them for tests.
  - Header keys arrive lowercased (undici `Headers`); a few assertions updated.
  - A redirect hop blocked on its own address reports `RedirectNotAllowedError`
    (curl 47) as before, and a resolution failure keeps its own message.

  ## Tests

  `dns-guarded-path.test.ts` covers the enforcing path by mocking
  `node:dns/promises` (guarded-fetch is inlined in the vitest configs so the mock
  reaches it): resolve-then-reject-private, fail-closed on resolution failure and
  empty answers, allow-listed hosts still resolved (the regression guard for
  `skipSsrfCheckForAllowedHosts`), per-hop re-resolution, and no resolution at all
  when enforcement is off. `browser-build.test.ts` bundles the module the way
  `build:browser` does and asserts no `guarded-fetch` import, no unhandled
  rejection on import, ambient-`fetch` requests, and fail-closed enforcement.

### Patch Changes

- [#400](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/400) [`f559fc1`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/f559fc1baadc6626fb88cb0446ac7740babb0d59) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - interpreter: give a bare assignment exit status 0 instead of the previous command's

  A command with no command word — `x=1`, `arr=(a b)`, `> file`, a `$empty` that expands to nothing — reported whatever `$?` already held rather than success. Bash gives such a command status 0 unless a command substitution ran while expanding it.

  The leak is invisible until something reads `$?`, and an `else` branch is where it bites: the branch runs with `$?` set to 1 by the condition that just failed, so an `else` branch ending in an assignment made the whole `if` report failure. Under `set -e` that ended the script with no output and no diagnostic:

  ```bash
  set -e
  if false; then :; else x=1; fi
  echo done                          # never ran
  ```

  A command substitution still sets the status where bash says it does. It counts from an assigned value or a redirection word, assignments expanded first and the last substitution winning: `x=$(exit 7)` is 7, `> /dev/null$(exit 5)` is 5, and `x=$(exit 7) > /dev/null$(exit 5)` is 5. A redirection onto fd 0 discards it and reports 0, matching bash 5.x, which forks a child to perform such a command's redirections. Process substitution never contributes, and neither does a command substitution in `PS4` under `set -x`.

- [#389](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/389) [`de3c2f3`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/de3c2f368ee1c11bab4d7250aaf43306e052a008) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Implement `curl -D` / `--dump-header` (file, `-`, `--dump-header=`, redirect hops, `-f` dumps). `curl -I` header blocks now end with a blank line (`\r\n\r\n`), matching real curl.

- [#378](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/378) [`a2a5843`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/a2a5843e4b3526148c7bab04dcd7be8e859e713a) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - curl: don't build the stdout string when the body is written to a file

  `curl -o FILE URL` (and `-O`) stringified the entire response body for stdout
  and then immediately discarded it, holding a full UTF-16 copy of the payload in
  memory alongside the bytes being written. Large downloads could exhaust memory
  (a browser-hosted embedder OOM'd its renderer on a 250 MB download). The stdout
  string is now skipped entirely on that path; `-v`, `--write-out`, `-I/--head`
  and all other behaviour are unchanged.

- [#365](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/365) [`bbf3881`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/bbf38812f621081f9c3203b7f887d1e5cb12dcaa) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - Report gzip files from their header instead of inflating them. `file` no longer enters `file-type`'s nested gzip probe, which decompressed up to 16 MB of input to look for an inner tar and leaked an `AbortError` unhandled rejection after the command had already returned. Gzipped tar archives now read as `gzip compressed data` rather than `gzip archive data`, matching `file`.

- [#397](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/397) [`062ce00`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/062ce005c0a7676163852fb6f0c8590cbdaa1d45) Thanks [@taoche](https://github.com/taoche)! - Run lazy file providers in the defense-in-depth trusted scope during materialization. Host-supplied providers doing real async I/O (`setTimeout`, `fetch`, `process.env`) previously tripped the blocked-globals traps when a script first read the file mid-exec, surfacing as a `SecurityViolationError` (formerly a silent empty read / ENOENT). Fixes [#253](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/issues/253).

- [#391](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/391) [`43c37ce`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/43c37cea24cea8e2f9ed9eab38906f85836f3502) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - ln: report a refused symlink as a symlink failure, not as a hard link on a directory

  `ln -s` against a filesystem constructed without symlink support failed with `ln: 'file.txt': hard link not allowed for directory`. Nothing in that sentence is true of the call: `-s` asks for a symbolic link rather than a hard one, and the named operand is the target rather than the directory the message blames.

  Both link kinds shared one `EPERM` branch, which carried the hard-link wording unconditionally. `link` reports `EPERM` only for a directory, so that wording is right there and is kept. `symlink` reports it when the filesystem allows no symlinks at all, which is a different condition with a different remedy, and it now reads `ln: failed to create symbolic link 'link': Operation not permitted`, matching the shape GNU `ln` uses and the shape this command already uses for `File exists`.

- [#363](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/363) [`4de3cd6`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4de3cd6e167bb54cf239aae92c45ac15cc9e2117) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - Append type indicators in `ls -l` only when `-F` asks for them. Long format previously suffixed every directory with `/` regardless, so a name read out of `ls -l` output carried a trailing slash that is not part of it, and `ls -l` disagreed with `ls` about what the same entry is called.

- [#390](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/390) [`b7f556f`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/b7f556fcbedc21ee4e346ad858f29c4d7d35a49e) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Bound `ls` directory entry collections before per-entry work. A filesystem backend returning a very large directory could previously drive `ls` into sorting, statting, classifying and formatting every entry before any limit applied, and piping to `head` did not help because pipeline producers are materialized before consumers run. Oversized listings now fail with exit code 126 (`array element limit exceeded` / `filesystem traversal entry limit exceeded`), the recursive descent no longer fans out across sibling directories, and every operand of a multi-directory listing is charged to the same budget.

- [#363](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/363) [`4de3cd6`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4de3cd6e167bb54cf239aae92c45ac15cc9e2117) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - Resolve `ls` operands as literal paths instead of matching them as glob patterns a second time. Pathname expansion is the shell's job, so an operand still holding `*`, `?` or `[` is a real filename; re-matching it made `ls 'report [1].pdf'` report an existing file as missing and stripped the leading directories from names containing `?` or `*`.

- [#363](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/363) [`4de3cd6`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4de3cd6e167bb54cf239aae92c45ac15cc9e2117) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - Group `ls` operands the way GNU and BSD `ls` do. Non-directory operands now print first as a single unseparated block in sort order, then each directory prints under a `name:` label preceded by a blank line. Previously every operand was separated by a blank line, including plain files, so `find … -exec ls -l {} +` and `xargs ls -l` returned a listing with an empty line between each entry.

- [#363](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/363) [`4de3cd6`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4de3cd6e167bb54cf239aae92c45ac15cc9e2117) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - Order `ls -R` sections by the active sort key, so `-t` and `-S` reach the descent rather than only each directory's own listing, and charge the traversal budget while resolving operands rather than only once the walk has started. Each operand costs one entry rather than two, `-d` charges its operands instead of returning before the budget sees them, and the metadata reads `-t` and `-S` need to sort are charged before they run.

- [#363](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/363) [`4de3cd6`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4de3cd6e167bb54cf239aae92c45ac15cc9e2117) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - Implement `ls -t`. The flag was parsed and discarded, so `ls -lt` silently returned the same name-ordered listing as `ls -l` while `--help` documented it as "sort by time, newest first". `-S` and `-t` now follow GNU's precedence, where whichever is written last wins, and both break ties by name so a listing no longer depends on the order the filesystem returned entries in. Sort keys come from `lstat`, so a symlink orders on its own size and mtime rather than its target's.

- [#454](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/454) [`022e260`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/022e260ec9bcdadd517704a3b96ffb5d948abd99) Thanks [@FredAmartey](https://github.com/FredAmartey)! - Let `ReadWriteFs.lstat` and `ReadWriteFs.readlink` accept the sandbox root. Both authorized a path by validating the directory above it, which for `/` lies outside the sandbox, so they failed with `EACCES`. Since 3.2.0 moved `find`, `du`, `chmod -R` and `file` onto `lstat`, `find .` and `find /` at the root printed nothing and exited 0. `du` and `chmod -R` reported `cannot access '/'` and `file /` reported `cannot open`. The root is now validated directly, as `mkdir` and `link` already do. Fixes [#402](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/issues/402).

- [#399](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/399) [`108c5cc`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/108c5ccf028e82bdcaabb2a5fd6b2640e56168f5) Thanks [@taoche](https://github.com/taoche)! - regex: cache compiled RE2 patterns across `UserRegex` constructions

  Every `createUserRegex()` call recompiled its pattern from source
  (`translateRegExp` → parse → simplify → compile). Commands that build a
  `UserRegex` inside a per-row loop therefore recompiled the same pattern once per
  row: jq's `test`/`match`/`capture`/`scan`/`splits`/`sub`/`gsub`, awk's `~`/`!~`
  and `sub`/`gsub`/`match`/`split`, and sed's `s///` (which compiled the same
  pattern twice per line for the `g` and Nth-occurrence paths). Compiling costs
  ~23µs against ~1.5µs to match with an already-compiled pattern, so compilation
  dominated these workloads.

  Compiled patterns are now memoized in a 256-entry cache keyed on the pattern and
  the RE2 flags, mirroring the existing glob regex cache in `src/utils/glob.ts`.
  Patterns longer than 1024 characters are compiled but not retained, bounding the
  cache's retained pattern source at 256 KiB. Only the compiled pattern is shared — `lastIndex`, the reusable matcher, result
  limits and the abort signal stay per-instance, so matching semantics are
  unchanged. Over 100k rows: jq `test()` 8.96s → 4.26s, awk `~` 4.15s → 2.55s,
  awk `gsub` 7.16s → 6.10s, sed `s///g` 10.46s → 8.29s. Commands that already
  hoisted compilation out of their loop (grep, rg) are unaffected.

- [#394](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/394) [`556a739`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/556a7397563f3db5b000329d58bc66fa0074ce77) Thanks [@cramforce](https://github.com/cramforce)! - Replace the custom js-exec QuickJS worker with run, using synchronous host bindings and native module loading while preserving filesystem, tools, process, fetch, output-limit, and cancellation behavior. Keep queue admission inside the JavaScript deadline, restore argv-only `spawnSync` execution, top-level-await module detection, optional tool exposure, and the historical 8 MiB per-call bridge ceiling. Make the aggregate bridge request ceiling configurable, bound filesystem and module reads before allocation, preserve module-loader and bootstrap diagnostics, and enforce source, generated guest configuration, and combined-output byte limits without allowing `process.exit()` to clear limit failures. Preserve binary `Buffer` filesystem writes and the `ArrayBuffer` filesystem contract, project command results before they cross into the guest, gate bootstrap-only host behavior to the bootstrap phase, parse guest stacks with bounded linear work, redact runtime stack paths, and forward cancellation through the companion executor into inline tool contexts and SDK Effect execution.

## 3.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#381](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/381) [`d40a42d`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/d40a42d514b22da4ed023635d747c8b3f029a6c5) Thanks [@cramforce](https://github.com/cramforce)! - Include the security and transform declaration trees referenced by the package entrypoints and worker declarations in published packages.

## 3.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#373](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/373) [`2c1831c`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/2c1831cc832d4b09ee4e1823526afb6ccca77942) Thanks [@cramforce](https://github.com/cramforce)! - Prevent defense-in-depth violation reporting from recursively overflowing the call stack in host runtimes that wrap `Date.now()`, honor configured main-thread violation exclusions, include actionable exclusion guidance for configurable violations, and keep constructor-execution protections non-excludable.

## 3.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#303](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/303) [`c5a2a4a`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/c5a2a4a35c7490276befa716acae3fe880c1fe89) Thanks [@boramuyar](https://github.com/boramuyar)! - Provide the shadowed bundled command to custom command overrides through `CommandContext.origCommand`.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#291](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/291) [`47f604a`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/47f604a7f1e12730318e4c88c7872a5a35383056) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - jq: add external-argument flags (`--arg`, `--argjson`, `--rawfile`, `--slurpfile`, `--args`, `--jsonargs`) and the `$ARGS` object (`$ARGS.named` / `$ARGS.positional`), matching real jq 1.7.1 behavior including exit codes, error messages, and prototype-sensitive key handling.

- [#336](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/336) [`d97425d`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/d97425dff8f51cfd773d22bc009561a09235cd1b) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Support user file descriptors (fd >= 3). `exec 3< file`, `N< file` / `N> file` / `N>> file` on any command, `read -u N`, `read <&N`, `>&N`, `N<&M`, and `N<&-` now go through a real descriptor table: a descriptor carries one shared read position, `exec` keeps it open until it is closed, and every other construct — including `done N< file` on a loop — gets it only for the duration of that command.

- [#331](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/331) [`6680247`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/66802470837cfac3a58a09e00d37b2070387ba7b) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Treat a `-` FILE operand in `grep` as standard input, matching GNU. `grep PATTERN -` now reads stdin instead of failing with "No such file or directory", stdin is labelled `(standard input)` in the multi-file prefix and in `-l`/`-L`/`-c` output, repeated `-` operands see the stream drained by the first one, and `-` is exempt from `-r` recursion and `--include`/`--exclude` filtering.

- [#325](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/325) [`edc7f2f`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/edc7f2fac5337cebd19911c5756b76ed02e52090) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Support process substitution `<(cmd)` and `>(cmd)`.

  `<(cmd)` runs `cmd` and substitutes a readable `/dev/fd/N` path backed by an
  in-memory file; `>(cmd)` substitutes a writable path whose contents are fed to
  `cmd` once the outer command finishes. Descriptors are numbered from 63
  downwards like bash and released when the command that opened them completes.
  Process substitutions retain their surrounding word context in assignments,
  conditionals, regular expressions, and heredoc delimiters. Previously any use
  raised `Parse error: Expected redirection target`.

- [#327](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/327) [`eaedb5b`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/eaedb5bc34cffd2077b88bb1ccc48ea7e0545a48) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Add `grep -f FILE` / `--file=FILE` to read patterns from a file (one per line). Patterns from `-f` OR-combine with `-e` patterns and with each other, `-f -` reads patterns from stdin, empty pattern lines match every line, and an empty pattern file selects nothing (exit 1). Newline-separated `PATTERNS` operands are now split into individual patterns, and `-x` groups alternatives correctly (`^(?:a|b)$`).

### Patch Changes

- [#358](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/358) [`bd1df37`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/bd1df37f8ff836355f470e95dcaa004b769d1e61) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - Parse and serialize bare file descriptor variable redirections such as `{output}>output.log` and `{input}<<EOF`. Bare redirects create their target with a command-scoped descriptor, while named command forms keep the allocated descriptor available.

- [#347](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/347) [`abb904b`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/abb904b1e126d14aa437b05f006df83117f06db3) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - Fix escaped reserved words being parsed as shell syntax. Unquoted escapes now retain their provenance through lexing and word parsing, including when the word is serialized back to Bash.

- [#332](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/332) [`4f9bdec`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4f9bdec02edb9eb72511546b759cb7e20bc2e27e) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Fix `grep -L` exit status to match GNU grep. The status reports whether a line
  was selected, not whether a filename was printed, so `grep -L` now exits 0 when
  every file matched (printing nothing) and 1 when no file matched (printing every
  name) — previously these were inverted.

- [#339](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/339) [`31d247f`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/31d247fe3a62f081b4462064da195552ab0a421c) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - network: restore private-range-enforced requests from the bundled build

  Every request made with `denyPrivateRanges` enabled failed with `Network access denied: DNS pinning unavailable for private IP enforcement`, so `curl` could not reach any host at all. The published ESM bundle was affected; source consumers and the CommonJS bundle were not.

  The pinned connection owner reads `Agent` and `fetch` off a dynamic `import("undici")`. Node's resolution of the package exposes those as named exports, but the ESM build inlines undici's CommonJS module into a chunk whose namespace carries it under `default` alone, so `Agent` was `undefined` and the `TypeError` from constructing it was reported as a runtime incapable of pinning.

  The namespace is now normalized before the transport is read off it, which also covers a consumer that bundles just-bash further.

  A statement that failed was written to **stdout** as `Error: ...` and the command still exited `0` unless `-bail` was passed. Real `sqlite3` writes the error to stderr and exits `1` in either mode; `-bail` only decides whether the remaining statements still run.

  Two consequences for callers: `sqlite3 db "SELECT ..." > out.csv` silently wrote the error text into the data file, and `sqlite3 db "..." && next-step` ran `next-step` after the query had failed, so a shell script could not detect a bad query without opting into `-bail` and losing the ability to see later statements.

  Errors now accumulate on stderr in statement order and the exit status is `1` whenever any statement failed. Successful runs are unchanged, `-bail` still stops at the first failure, and the partial stdout produced before a failure is still emitted. Writeback of a partially-successful script is also unchanged.

  `Sandbox.create(opts)` previously constructed its internal `Bash` with only a subset
  of `BashOptions`, silently dropping the optional capability flags (`python`,
  `javascript`, `commands`, `customCommands`, `fetch`). A host that drives just-bash
  through the `Sandbox` API (rather than `new Bash(...)`) therefore could not enable
  python3, js-exec, a restricted command set, custom commands, or a custom fetch — even
  though the runtimes ship in the package.

  `SandboxOptions` now exposes those fields and `Sandbox.create` forwards them into the
  `Bash` it builds. Behavior is unchanged when a caller omits them (each falls back to
  its existing `BashOptions` default — Python/js-exec stay off, the full command set
  stays available). Fixes the root cause behind vercel/eve#431.

  jq string interpolation of the form `"\(...)"` that contained a nested double-quoted string — for example `"\(sub("T.*";""))"` or `"\(ltrimstr("ab"))"` — previously failed with a parse error. The tokenizer terminated the outer string at the first `"` it saw inside the interpolation expression, so the rest of the expression became orphaned tokens.

  The lexer now tracks `\(...)` depth while consuming a string literal and treats nested `"..."` pairs as opaque content while inside an interpolation, restoring them verbatim into the captured interpolation source. `parseStringInterpolation` similarly skips over nested strings when balancing parentheses, so the interpolation expression is captured as a whole and handed to the expression parser intact.

  Any non-`export` variable assignment (bare `SECRET=s`, prefixed `SECRET=s cmd`,
  or before a custom command) failed with a defense-in-depth security violation
  (`dynamic import of Node.js builtin 'node:module' is blocked during script
execution`), while plain commands and `export`-ed assignments passed.

  `processScalarAssignment()` resolved `isArray` via `await import("./expansion.js")`
  in two spots. In the bundled `dist`, that dynamic `import()` marks `expansion.js`
  as a lazily-linked chunk whose `createRequire` banner imports `node:module`; the
  defense layer's ESM `resolve` hook blocks that builtin import when the sandbox is
  active and untrusted, so it blocked just-bash's own chunk load. The file already
  statically imports from `./expansion.js`, so `isArray` is now pulled from that
  static import and the two lazy imports are removed — no lazy `node:module`-bearing
  chunk is linked at runtime. No public API change.

- [#276](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/276) [`1ec5eec`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/1ec5eec0aefd099d23ac9f056df1e6612c81d49b) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - interpreter: preserve leading whitespace in multi-line quoted strings (fixes [#259](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/issues/259))

  `exec()` runs each script through `normalizeScript()`, which `trimStart()`s
  leading indentation from lines so indented template-literal scripts parse. It
  was applied line-by-line and stripped the leading whitespace inside multi-line
  single- and double-quoted strings too. The visible symptom was `python3 -c
'...'` (and `node -e`, `awk`, etc.) with an indented body failing with
  `IndentationError`, while the same code via heredoc or pipe worked.

  `normalizeScript()` is now quote-aware (mirroring the earlier heredoc-aware
  fix): it only strips indentation from lines that begin outside any quote, and
  preserves lines that begin inside an unterminated single- or double-quoted
  string verbatim. This also un-skips four sed spec tests whose indented stdin
  was previously being corrupted.

- [#286](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/286) [`cb2b583`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/cb2b583b3f46e6bb4e6982c4bfe19903ec811a87) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - interpreter: deliver redirected output to each fd's final target (fixes `cmd > file 2>&1` leaking stderr to stdout)

  `applyRedirections()` processed a command's redirection list sequentially over
  the result's stdout/stderr strings, moving content at each step. The
  duplication operators (`2>&1`, `1>&2`) merged into the live stream regardless
  of where the source fd pointed, so the canonical `cmd > file 2>&1` wrote
  stdout to the file but leaked stderr onto the caller's stdout — including
  "command not found" errors and custom-command stderr. Any wrapper protocol
  that parses the enclosing script's stdout (e.g. a runner emitting a JSON
  payload after `eval "$CMD" > "$OUT" 2>&1`) saw the leaked stderr corrupt its
  stream. Ordering variants were wrong in other ways: `cmd 2>&1 > file` put
  stderr in the file instead of on stdout, and `cmd > a > b` wrote content to
  `a` instead of `b`.

  The pass now mirrors how bash sets up fds before running the command: each
  output redirection only opens/truncates its target and re-points the fd's
  sink (file, /dev/null, or a snapshot of the caller-visible stream), and
  duplication operators copy the source fd's current sink. Stream content is
  delivered once, after the whole list is processed, to each fd's final sink.
  This makes `cmd > file 2>&1` send stderr to the file, `cmd 2>&1 > file` keep
  stderr on the caller's stdout, `cmd > all 2>&1 2> err` let the later `2> err`
  reclaim stderr, and `cmd > a > b` truncate `a` while writing content to `b`.
  The `/dev/null`-as-regular-VFS-file behavior for stdout redirects is
  preserved.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#272](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/272) [`150a915`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/150a915a1d45a2cc7f2b6aec3268f27116c34916) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - interpreter: fix UTF-8 mojibake when a script interleaves text-output and byte-output statements

  A single `exec()` can interleave text-shaped statements (sed, awk, echo — `ö`
  as `U+00F6`) with byte-shaped ones (grep | head, cat — `ö` as bytes
  `0xC3 0xB6`). `executeScript` / `executeStatement` concatenated each result's
  raw stdout, so the lone high byte from the text half made the combined stream
  invalid UTF-8, the output-boundary decoder bailed, and the byte half came back
  as Latin-1 mojibake (`KÃ¶penicker` for `Köpenicker`). The same path backs
  command substitution, so `echo "你好: $(cat /file)"` was affected too.

  The fix decodes each statement/pipeline result to text via its explicit
  `stdoutKind` (`decodedTextFromResult`) before concatenating — no guessing from
  string contents, so text whose code units merely look like UTF-8 (`Ã¶`) is
  preserved. `tac` (stdin path) and `curl` (response body) now declare
  `stdoutKind: "bytes"` on the results that forward raw bytes, so the decode is
  driven per output rather than by inspecting characters.

  Real curl reads file contents when these flags are passed `@filename`:

  - `-d @file` / `--data @file` — read file contents, strip CR/LF.
  - `--data-binary @file` — read file contents verbatim (newlines preserved).
  - `--data-urlencode @file` — read file, URL-encode the contents.
  - `--data-urlencode name@file` — prefix the URL-encoded contents with `name=`.

  just-bash's curl previously passed `@filename` through verbatim as the HTTP body. Posting JSON or any non-trivial payload via `curl --data-binary @payload.json https://…` sent the literal string `@payload.json` instead of the file. The new behavior matches upstream curl; `--data-raw` keeps the documented "no `@` interpretation" semantics.

- [#262](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/262) [`4ece258`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4ece2580d8cb707e6c6b7fa22897ea3fdd21739a) Thanks [@chernetsov](https://github.com/chernetsov)! - parser: don't treat quotes inside a heredoc body as shell quotes when finding the end of a command substitution

  A command substitution whose body contained a heredoc with an unbalanced quote in its body — most commonly an apostrophe in literal prose, e.g. `June's` — failed to parse with `bash: syntax error: ... unexpected EOF while looking for matching ')'`:

  ```bash
  OUT=$(cat <<'SCRIPT'
  June's moon
  SCRIPT
  )
  ```

  Both the lexer's `$(...)` word scanner and the substitution boundary scanner walked into the heredoc body and applied shell quote tracking to it. The `'` in `June's` opened a single-quoted string that never closed, so the closing `)` was swallowed and the scan ran to EOF. In bash a heredoc body is literal text and must be skipped wholesale when locating the substitution boundary.

  Both scanners are now heredoc-aware: when scanning a `$(...)` they recognize `<<` / `<<-` operators (but not the `<<<` here-string), capture the possibly-quoted delimiter, and skip the heredoc body lines literally — without quote or paren tracking — up to the terminator. Multiple heredocs on one line and tab-stripping (`<<-`) are handled. This fixes the common pattern of capturing the output of a connector/CLI invocation that is fed a heredoc script containing apostrophes, backticks, or parentheses.

  The heredoc scan also tracks arithmetic `((...))` nesting so a `<<` left-shift inside `$((...))` (or a nested arithmetic expansion) is not mistaken for a heredoc opener — previously a multi-line arithmetic expansion containing a shift, e.g. `$((\n1 << 2\n))`, had its closing `))` swallowed by spurious body-skipping.

  Anchored alternation patterns like `^def \|^async def` now extract literal needles (stripping outer `^`/`$`), enabling the `String.indexOf` fast-path. Files with no matching needle are rejected before `split("\n")`, skipping RE2 entirely. `acquireMatcher()` extended to `match()`, `replace()`, `search()`, and `matchAll()` to reduce GC pressure across awk/sed hot-paths.

- [#261](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/261) [`c9904de`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/c9904dea24ad2aa847749ee6289239c2a2c651fc) Thanks [@chernetsov](https://github.com/chernetsov)! - set: support a bundled `-o`/`+o` long option inside a short-flag cluster (e.g. `set -euo pipefail`)

  The `set` builtin previously rejected `set -euo pipefail` with `bash: set: -o: invalid option`, because it parsed each character after the `-` as an independent short flag and has no `o` short flag. `-o` was only honored as its own token (`set -eu -o pipefail`).

  This is the canonical "bash strict mode" idiom and is extremely common in generated scripts, so the whole script would abort on its first line.

  `set` now matches bash: an `o` inside a cluster consumes the _next word_ as its long-option name, and the remaining characters keep being parsed as short flags. So `set -euo pipefail` is equivalent to `set -e -u -o pipefail`, `set -oe pipefail` enables both `pipefail` and `errexit`, trailing words become positional parameters, and `+`-clusters (`set +euo pipefail`) disable the options. An invalid bundled name (`set -euo bogus`) still reports `invalid option name`, and an `o` with no following argument falls back to the standalone `-o`/`+o` listing.
