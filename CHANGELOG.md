### Minor Changes

- [#291](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/291) [`47f604a`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/47f604a7f1e12730318e4c88c7872a5a35383056) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - jq: add external-argument flags (`--arg`, `--argjson`, `--rawfile`, `--slurpfile`, `--args`, `--jsonargs`) and the `$ARGS` object (`$ARGS.named` / `$ARGS.positional`), matching real jq 1.7.1 behavior including exit codes, error messages, and prototype-sensitive key handling.

- [#336](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/336) [`d97425d`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/d97425dff8f51cfd773d22bc009561a09235cd1b) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Support user file descriptors (fd >= 3). `exec 3< file`, `N< file` / `N> file` / `N>> file` on any command, `read -u N`, `read <&N`, `>&N`, `N<&M`, and `N<&-` now go through a real descriptor table: a descriptor carries one shared read position, `exec` keeps it open until it is closed, and every other construct — including `done N< file` on a loop — gets it only for the duration of that command.

- [#331](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/331) [`6680247`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/66802470837cfac3a58a09e00d37b2070387ba7b) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Treat a `-` FILE operand in `grep` as standard input, matching GNU. `grep PATTERN -` now reads stdin instead of failing with "No such file or directory", stdin is labelled `(standard input)` in the multi-file prefix and in `-l`/`-L`/`-c` output, repeated `-` operands see the stream drained by the first one, and `-` is exempt from `-r` recursion and `--include`/`--exclude` filtering.

- [#325](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/325) [`edc7f2f`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/edc7f2fac5337cebd19911c5756b76ed02e52090) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Support process substitution `<(cmd)` and `>(cmd)`.

  `<(cmd)` runs `cmd` and substitutes a readable `/dev/fd/N` path backed by an
  in-memory file; `>(cmd)` substitutes a writable path whose contents are fed to
  `cmd` once the outer command finishes. Descriptors are numbered from 63
  downwards like bash and released when the command that opened them completes.
  Process substitutions retain their surrounding word context in assignments,
  conditionals, regular expressions, and heredoc delimiters. Previously any use
  raised `Parse error: Expected redirection target`.

- [#327](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/327) [`eaedb5b`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/eaedb5bc34cffd2077b88bb1ccc48ea7e0545a48) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Add `grep -f FILE` / `--file=FILE` to read patterns from a file (one per line). Patterns from `-f` OR-combine with `-e` patterns and with each other, `-f -` reads patterns from stdin, empty pattern lines match every line, and an empty pattern file selects nothing (exit 1). Newline-separated `PATTERNS` operands are now split into individual patterns, and `-x` groups alternatives correctly (`^(?:a|b)$`).

### Patch Changes

- [#358](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/358) [`bd1df37`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/bd1df37f8ff836355f470e95dcaa004b769d1e61) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - Parse and serialize bare file descriptor variable redirections such as `{output}>output.log` and `{input}<<EOF`. Bare redirects create their target with a command-scoped descriptor, while named command forms keep the allocated descriptor available.

- [#347](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/347) [`abb904b`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/abb904b1e126d14aa437b05f006df83117f06db3) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - Fix escaped reserved words being parsed as shell syntax. Unquoted escapes now retain their provenance through lexing and word parsing, including when the word is serialized back to Bash.

- [#332](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/332) [`4f9bdec`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4f9bdec02edb9eb72511546b759cb7e20bc2e27e) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Fix `grep -L` exit status to match GNU grep. The status reports whether a line
  was selected, not whether a filename was printed, so `grep -L` now exits 0 when
  every file matched (printing nothing) and 1 when no file matched (printing every
  name) — previously these were inverted.

- [#339](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/339) [`31d247f`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/31d247fe3a62f081b4462064da195552ab0a421c) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - network: restore private-range-enforced requests from the bundled build

  Every request made with `denyPrivateRanges` enabled failed with `Network access denied: DNS pinning unavailable for private IP enforcement`, so `curl` could not reach any host at all. The published ESM bundle was affected; source consumers and the CommonJS bundle were not.

  The pinned connection owner reads `Agent` and `fetch` off a dynamic `import("undici")`. Node's resolution of the package exposes those as named exports, but the ESM build inlines undici's CommonJS module into a chunk whose namespace carries it under `default` alone, so `Agent` was `undefined` and the `TypeError` from constructing it was reported as a runtime incapable of pinning.

  The namespace is now normalized before the transport is read off it, which also covers a consumer that bundles just-bash further.

- [#348](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/348) [`1a7940d`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/1a7940ddf91dec8f69125474a40cef1adebabee9) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - Reject unsupported command-leading reserved words in every parser context instead of discarding them or executing them as simple commands. Unknown command AST nodes now fail explicitly instead of returning a successful result.

- [#345](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/345) [`2208a34`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/2208a34e27d33a2fce712fbd024875ec60747553) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - Restore command groups and subshells after the process-substitution and stdin-ownership changes were combined without forwarding ownership through inner command dispatch.

- [#336](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/336) [`d97425d`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/d97425dff8f51cfd773d22bc009561a09235cd1b) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Apply output redirections attached to `while` and `until` loops. `while true; do echo x; break; done >/dev/null` no longer leaks its output to the caller, and `> file`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>&1`, `&>` and `>|` now behave on loops the way they already did on `for` and `case`. `until` loops also gained the input-redirection handling `while` loops already had, so `until ! read l; do ...; done < file` reads from the file. A loop now only restores stdin it owns, so reading inside a loop no longer rewinds an enclosing group's read position: `printf 'a\nb\n' | { while read x; do break; done; read y; }` sees `y=b`.

- [#328](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/328) [`65dafd5`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/65dafd55afbfa7e62642ce485787f7d65fad4961) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - Stop pipelines from draining the enclosing shell's stdin, so `while read …; do … | …; done < file` runs once per line again.

- [#349](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/349) [`be55fec`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/be55fec4e23b3f5a42cf8eaeb6939b379f741ae1) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - Process redirections through policy-driven transactions that preserve Bash ordering, descriptor lifetimes, persistent `exec` routes, compound-command stdin, control-flow output routing, and shared read-write descriptor positions without duplicate expansion or opening.

- [#368](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/368) [`3ee215c`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/3ee215c2ad56c96ce0d88e2813050df9f15afa38) Thanks [@cramforce](https://github.com/cramforce)! - FS sym-link hardening

- [#338](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/338) [`19a02c2`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/19a02c297d110fde8a8a3376d6956c2c549d128e) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - sqlite3: report failed statements on stderr and exit non-zero without `-bail`

  A statement that failed was written to **stdout** as `Error: ...` and the command still exited `0` unless `-bail` was passed. Real `sqlite3` writes the error to stderr and exits `1` in either mode; `-bail` only decides whether the remaining statements still run.

  Two consequences for callers: `sqlite3 db "SELECT ..." > out.csv` silently wrote the error text into the data file, and `sqlite3 db "..." && next-step` ran `next-step` after the query had failed, so a shell script could not detect a bad query without opting into `-bail` and losing the ability to see later statements.

  Errors now accumulate on stderr in statement order and the exit status is `1` whenever any statement failed. Successful runs are unchanged, `-bail` still stops at the first failure, and the partial stdout produced before a failure is still emitted. Writeback of a partially-successful script is also unchanged.

- [#360](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/360) [`1fbde34`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/1fbde341d74ff7f933d9cead9a390a6ab65b5df3) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - Preserve whether a here-document ended at its delimiter or at end-of-input. Unterminated final body lines now receive Bash's trailing newline, backslash-newline continuations are removed during expansion, and serialization rejects unterminated documents rather than manufacturing a closing delimiter.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#304](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/304) [`3d39a71`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/3d39a714b3751cedc173dffae27933dfe7b8b3b5) Thanks [@subsetpark](https://github.com/subsetpark)! - Add curl `-G`/`--get` query-string data handling and preserve command-line order when repeated `-d`, `--data-raw`, `--data-binary`, and `--data-urlencode` options are mixed, including `@file` forms. Data requests now also set curl's standard `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type unless the caller supplies one.

- [#307](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/307) [`7c4caed`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/7c4caedf02599628f19b243f960d480760f5e476) Thanks [@cramforce](https://github.com/cramforce)! - Harden untrusted execution with shared aggregate budgets, liberal normal and
  opt-in hardened limit profiles, request-bound network validation, bounded
  archive and worker processing, transactional filesystem and shell state, and
  expanded adversarial regression checks.

  Established command declarations and host-extension defaults remain source
  compatible. Dispatched callbacks receive a `ResolvedCommandContext` with
  required limits; applications can use `createCommandContext({ fs })` for direct
  invocation, opt into restricted custom-command execution with `trusted: false`,
  and select tighter resource policy with the `hardened` profile. All
  host-registration paths keep their established trusted default. The supported
  Node.js floor is now declared as `>=20.18.1`.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#284](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/284) [`af2e0f4`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/af2e0f4cdeb5417ea59e25140038c239dd8fd92d) Thanks [@arimxyer](https://github.com/arimxyer)! - sandbox: forward capability flags from `SandboxOptions` into the underlying `Bash`

  `Sandbox.create(opts)` previously constructed its internal `Bash` with only a subset
  of `BashOptions`, silently dropping the optional capability flags (`python`,
  `javascript`, `commands`, `customCommands`, `fetch`). A host that drives just-bash
  through the `Sandbox` API (rather than `new Bash(...)`) therefore could not enable
  python3, js-exec, a restricted command set, custom commands, or a custom fetch — even
  though the runtimes ship in the package.

  `SandboxOptions` now exposes those fields and `Sandbox.create` forwards them into the
  `Bash` it builds. Behavior is unchanged when a caller omits them (each falls back to
  its existing `BashOptions` default — Python/js-exec stay off, the full command set
  stays available). Fixes the root cause behind vercel/eve#431.

### Patch Changes

- [#268](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/268) [`7a5a0b9`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/7a5a0b9ae3bf0524722653cbf4b45e6bc176cf22) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - jq: allow nested double-quoted strings inside `"\(...)"` string interpolation

  jq string interpolation of the form `"\(...)"` that contained a nested double-quoted string — for example `"\(sub("T.*";""))"` or `"\(ltrimstr("ab"))"` — previously failed with a parse error. The tokenizer terminated the outer string at the first `"` it saw inside the interpolation expression, so the rest of the expression became orphaned tokens.

  The lexer now tracks `\(...)` depth while consuming a string literal and treats nested `"..."` pairs as opaque content while inside an interpolation, restoring them verbatim into the captured interpolation source. `parseStringInterpolation` similarly skips over nested strings when balancing parentheses, so the interpolation expression is captured as a whole and handed to the expression parser intact.

## 3.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [#277](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/277) [`aec5643`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/aec56431d7d9b6fcb141bbfe25d26f4931f54f80) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - interpreter: avoid lazy import in variable assignment path that trips defense-in-depth (fixes [#273](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/issues/273))

  Any non-`export` variable assignment (bare `SECRET=s`, prefixed `SECRET=s cmd`,
  or before a custom command) failed with a defense-in-depth security violation
  (`dynamic import of Node.js builtin 'node:module' is blocked during script
execution`), while plain commands and `export`-ed assignments passed.

  `processScalarAssignment()` resolved `isArray` via `await import("./expansion.js")`
  in two spots. In the bundled `dist`, that dynamic `import()` marks `expansion.js`
  as a lazily-linked chunk whose `createRequire` banner imports `node:module`; the
  defense layer's ESM `resolve` hook blocks that builtin import when the sandbox is
  active and untrusted, so it blocked just-bash's own chunk load. The file already
  statically imports from `./expansion.js`, so `isArray` is now pulled from that
  static import and the two lazy imports are removed — no lazy `node:module`-bearing
  chunk is linked at runtime. No public API change.

- [#276](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/276) [`1ec5eec`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/1ec5eec0aefd099d23ac9f056df1e6612c81d49b) Thanks [@mutewinter](https://github.com/mutewinter)! - interpreter: preserve leading whitespace in multi-line quoted strings (fixes [#259](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/issues/259))

  `exec()` runs each script through `normalizeScript()`, which `trimStart()`s
  leading indentation from lines so indented template-literal scripts parse. It
  was applied line-by-line and stripped the leading whitespace inside multi-line
  single- and double-quoted strings too. The visible symptom was `python3 -c
'...'` (and `node -e`, `awk`, etc.) with an indented body failing with
  `IndentationError`, while the same code via heredoc or pipe worked.

  `normalizeScript()` is now quote-aware (mirroring the earlier heredoc-aware
  fix): it only strips indentation from lines that begin outside any quote, and
  preserves lines that begin inside an unterminated single- or double-quoted
  string verbatim. This also un-skips four sed spec tests whose indented stdin
  was previously being corrupted.

- [#286](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/286) [`cb2b583`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/cb2b583b3f46e6bb4e6982c4bfe19903ec811a87) Thanks [@privatenumber](https://github.com/privatenumber)! - interpreter: deliver redirected output to each fd's final target (fixes `cmd > file 2>&1` leaking stderr to stdout)

  `applyRedirections()` processed a command's redirection list sequentially over
  the result's stdout/stderr strings, moving content at each step. The
  duplication operators (`2>&1`, `1>&2`) merged into the live stream regardless
  of where the source fd pointed, so the canonical `cmd > file 2>&1` wrote
  stdout to the file but leaked stderr onto the caller's stdout — including
  "command not found" errors and custom-command stderr. Any wrapper protocol
  that parses the enclosing script's stdout (e.g. a runner emitting a JSON
  payload after `eval "$CMD" > "$OUT" 2>&1`) saw the leaked stderr corrupt its
  stream. Ordering variants were wrong in other ways: `cmd 2>&1 > file` put
  stderr in the file instead of on stdout, and `cmd > a > b` wrote content to
  `a` instead of `b`.

  The pass now mirrors how bash sets up fds before running the command: each
  output redirection only opens/truncates its target and re-points the fd's
  sink (file, /dev/null, or a snapshot of the caller-visible stream), and
  duplication operators copy the source fd's current sink. Stream content is
  delivered once, after the whole list is processed, to each fd's final sink.
  This makes `cmd > file 2>&1` send stderr to the file, `cmd 2>&1 > file` keep
  stderr on the caller's stdout, `cmd > all 2>&1 2> err` let the later `2> err`
  reclaim stderr, and `cmd > a > b` truncate `a` while writing content to `b`.
  The `/dev/null`-as-regular-VFS-file behavior for stdout redirects is
  preserved.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#272](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/272) [`150a915`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/150a915a1d45a2cc7f2b6aec3268f27116c34916) Thanks [@trieloff](https://github.com/trieloff)! - interpreter: fix UTF-8 mojibake when a script interleaves text-output and byte-output statements

  A single `exec()` can interleave text-shaped statements (sed, awk, echo — `ö`
  as `U+00F6`) with byte-shaped ones (grep | head, cat — `ö` as bytes
  `0xC3 0xB6`). `executeScript` / `executeStatement` concatenated each result's
  raw stdout, so the lone high byte from the text half made the combined stream
  invalid UTF-8, the output-boundary decoder bailed, and the byte half came back
  as Latin-1 mojibake (`KÃ¶penicker` for `Köpenicker`). The same path backs
  command substitution, so `echo "你好: $(cat /file)"` was affected too.

  The fix decodes each statement/pipeline result to text via its explicit
  `stdoutKind` (`decodedTextFromResult`) before concatenating — no guessing from
  string contents, so text whose code units merely look like UTF-8 (`Ã¶`) is
  preserved. `tac` (stdin path) and `curl` (response body) now declare
  `stdoutKind: "bytes"` on the results that forward raw bytes, so the decode is
  driven per output rather than by inspecting characters.

  Real curl reads file contents when these flags are passed `@filename`:

  - `-d @file` / `--data @file` — read file contents, strip CR/LF.
  - `--data-binary @file` — read file contents verbatim (newlines preserved).
  - `--data-urlencode @file` — read file, URL-encode the contents.
  - `--data-urlencode name@file` — prefix the URL-encoded contents with `name=`.

  just-bash's curl previously passed `@filename` through verbatim as the HTTP body. Posting JSON or any non-trivial payload via `curl --data-binary @payload.json https://…` sent the literal string `@payload.json` instead of the file. The new behavior matches upstream curl; `--data-raw` keeps the documented "no `@` interpretation" semantics.

- [#262](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/262) [`4ece258`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/4ece2580d8cb707e6c6b7fa22897ea3fdd21739a) Thanks [@chernetsov](https://github.com/chernetsov)! - parser: don't treat quotes inside a heredoc body as shell quotes when finding the end of a command substitution

  A command substitution whose body contained a heredoc with an unbalanced quote in its body — most commonly an apostrophe in literal prose, e.g. `June's` — failed to parse with `bash: syntax error: ... unexpected EOF while looking for matching ')'`:

  ```bash
  OUT=$(cat <<'SCRIPT'
  June's moon
  SCRIPT
  )
  ```

  Both the lexer's `$(...)` word scanner and the substitution boundary scanner walked into the heredoc body and applied shell quote tracking to it. The `'` in `June's` opened a single-quoted string that never closed, so the closing `)` was swallowed and the scan ran to EOF. In bash a heredoc body is literal text and must be skipped wholesale when locating the substitution boundary.

  Both scanners are now heredoc-aware: when scanning a `$(...)` they recognize `<<` / `<<-` operators (but not the `<<<` here-string), capture the possibly-quoted delimiter, and skip the heredoc body lines literally — without quote or paren tracking — up to the terminator. Multiple heredocs on one line and tab-stripping (`<<-`) are handled. This fixes the common pattern of capturing the output of a connector/CLI invocation that is fed a heredoc script containing apostrophes, backticks, or parentheses.

  The heredoc scan also tracks arithmetic `((...))` nesting so a `<<` left-shift inside `$((...))` (or a nested arithmetic expansion) is not mistaken for a heredoc opener — previously a multi-line arithmetic expansion containing a shift, e.g. `$((\n1 << 2\n))`, had its closing `))` swallowed by spurious body-skipping.

  Anchored alternation patterns like `^def \|^async def` now extract literal needles (stripping outer `^`/`$`), enabling the `String.indexOf` fast-path. Files with no matching needle are rejected before `split("\n")`, skipping RE2 entirely. `acquireMatcher()` extended to `match()`, `replace()`, `search()`, and `matchAll()` to reduce GC pressure across awk/sed hot-paths.

- [#261](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/261) [`c9904de`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/c9904dea24ad2aa847749ee6289239c2a2c651fc) Thanks [@chernetsov](https://github.com/chernetsov)! - set: support a bundled `-o`/`+o` long option inside a short-flag cluster (e.g. `set -euo pipefail`)

  The `set` builtin previously rejected `set -euo pipefail` with `bash: set: -o: invalid option`, because it parsed each character after the `-` as an independent short flag and has no `o` short flag. `-o` was only honored as its own token (`set -eu -o pipefail`).

  This is the canonical "bash strict mode" idiom and is extremely common in generated scripts, so the whole script would abort on its first line.

  `set` now matches bash: an `o` inside a cluster consumes the _next word_ as its long-option name, and the remaining characters keep being parsed as short flags. So `set -euo pipefail` is equivalent to `set -e -u -o pipefail`, `set -oe pipefail` enables both `pipefail` and `errexit`, trailing words become positional parameters, and `+`-clusters (`set +euo pipefail`) disable the options. An invalid bundled name (`set -euo bogus`) still reports `invalid option name`, and an `o` with no following argument falls back to the standalone `-o`/`+o` listing.

### Patch Changes

- [#238](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/238) [`01a4721`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/01a4721324350adea4b035b311f0b60ccdbb65ff) Thanks [@cramforce](https://github.com/cramforce)! - Fix `Dynamic require of "tty" is not supported` crash when invoking commands that transitively load `debug` / `supports-color` (notably `file`) under ESM Node consumers and via the `just-bash` CLI binary.

  The esbuild dynamic-require shim emitted into the ESM Node bundles had no `require` to delegate to at chunk-init under ESM, so any runtime `require("tty")` / `require("os")` from `file-type` → `debug` chain threw. Build banners now provide `createRequire(import.meta.url)` for `build:lib`, `build:cli`, and `build:shell`. CJS and browser bundles are unchanged.

  Fixes [#211](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/issues/211).

### Patch Changes

- [#206](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/pull/206) [`6ccc35f`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash/commit/6ccc35f5a9b5c6f395b145ed2ec7ee71c4862057) Thanks [@subsetpark](https://github.com/subsetpark)! - Fix awk lexer to honor POSIX statement continuation across newlines after `,`,
  `{`, `&&`, `||`, `?`, `:`, `do`, `else`, `if`, and `while`. Previously, a
  multi-line idiom like `printf "%s=%d\n", \n  $1, $2` (comma at end-of-line
  followed by indented args on the next line) failed with `Unexpected token:
NEWLINE` because the lexer emitted a NEWLINE token unconditionally. The
  lexer now suppresses the NEWLINE when it immediately follows one of the
  continuation-allowing tokens, matching POSIX awk.
